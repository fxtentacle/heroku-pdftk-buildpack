Custom buildpack that will install pdftk into /app/bin on Heroku. Supports cedar-14 and heroku-16.

# How to use

1. Add this buildpack to your app. 
3. Use /app/bin/pdftk. BTW, the default cedar-14 PATH includes /app/bin, so this might happen automatically.

# How to upgrade PDFTK

Update the tarball_url line in scripts/build.sh

`heroku create`

`heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-apt`

`git push heroku master`

Now you'll have a new Heroku app on the default stack (currently cedar-14) that runs the `scrupts/build.sh` script in this buildpack. That script will download the most recent PDFTK source and configure it with default options.

Use `heroku logs -t` to see when compilation is done. It'll start showing dots..

`heroku open`

1. Download the generated pdftk.zip
2. Chmod +x them
3. put them into `bin/$STACK/` into this buildpack. $STACK shall be the name of your stack as given in the Heroku $STACK variable.

`heroku ps:scale web=0` to turn off the dyno.
